Flower Learner.

This app is intended to take a photo upload, run machine learning image recognition on it, and then return the classification of photo.  In particular, it recognizes types of flower.

As is, the app does not work.  To make it work, I will have to restart it using TensorFlow for React, instead of TensorFlow for python.  
Technologies Used: React, TensorFlow, Node.js, Express, JS, HTML, CSS
